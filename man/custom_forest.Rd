\usage{
custom_forest(X, Y, sample.fraction = 0.5, mtry = NULL, num.trees = 2000,
  num.threads = NULL, min.node.size = NULL, honesty = TRUE,
  alpha = 0.05, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The covariates used in the regression.}

\item{Y}{The outcome.}

\item{sample.fraction}{Fraction of the data used to build each tree.
Note: If honesty is used, these subsamples will
further be cut in half.}

\item{mtry}{Number of variables tried for each split.}

\item{num.trees}{Number of trees grown in the forest. Note: Getting accurate
confidence intervals generally requires more trees than
getting accurate predictions.}

\item{num.threads}{Number of threads used in training. If set to NULL, the software
automatically selects an appropriate amount.}

\item{min.node.size}{A target for the minimum number of observations in each tree leaf. Note that nodes
with size smaller than min.node.size can occur, as in the original randomForest package.}

\item{honesty}{Whether or not honest splitting (i.e., sub-sample splitting) should be used.}

\item{alpha}{Maximum imbalance of a split.}

\item{seed}{The seed for the C++ random number generator.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored).}
}
\value{
A trained regression forest object.
